## 🚀 Getting Started

Setting up K-Orbit is straightforward. Follow these steps to get your local development environment running.

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (v18.0.0 or higher)
- **Python** (v3.11 or higher)
- **Docker** (Recommended for easy, consistent setup)
- **Supabase Account**
- **Google Gemini API Key**

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/k-orbit.git
cd k-orbit
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Copy the example environment file and fill in your credentials.
```bash
cp env.example .env
nano .env
```
You will need to add your API keys from Supabase and Google AI Studio. Also review `env.example` for all required variables (frontend, backend, Supabase, AI, and deployment) to ensure your environment is complete before running or deploying.

### 3. Set Up the Database
Log in to your Supabase account and perform the following steps:
1.  **Create a new project.**
2.  Navigate to the **SQL Editor**.
3.  Copy the entire contents of `infra/schema.sql` and run it to set up your database tables.
4.  Run the following command in the SQL Editor to enable vector search:
    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
    ```

### 4. Run the Application

**Option A: With Docker (Recommended)**

The simplest way to start the entire application stack:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000` and the backend at `http://localhost:8000`.

**Option B: Manual Setup**

If you prefer to run the services manually:

**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

**Frontend:**
*If you see TypeScript or module errors, they are expected and will be resolved by the `npm install` command.*
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 5. Verify Your Setup
- **Frontend App**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend API Docs**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- **AI Coach**: Log in and click the floating bot icon.
